To extract the OSTAR2002 datasets to build the radiation tables
used in the individual star stellar feedback routines in Enzo:

1) Download the OSTAR2002 tables from:
   http://tlusty.oca.eu/Tlusty2002/tlusty-frames-cloudy.html

   This must be the OSTAR2002 tables re-binned for CLOUDY listed
   as one .ascii.gz file per metallicity. Not all files need to be 
   downloaded, but the full table makes use of all but the z = 0 
   tables. (9 files total)

2) use extract_sed.py to processes these files into a more uniform
   and processible format needed for the remaining steps
